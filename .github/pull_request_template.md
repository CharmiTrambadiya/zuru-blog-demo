The following is the omnicomprehensive template for the Pull Request.

Complete the section about your specific scenario.

### 1. Submit a new article

_Follow this template to check if your article can be submitted._

Please check to satisfy these requirements:

* [ ] Please check your author information: `/_data/authors.yml`: if it is not present add it.
* [ ] In the article meta the `tags` section is used for the team name. The team list can be find under the section `themeColor` in `_config.yml`: if your team is not present just add it.
* [ ] Double check the grammar using Grammarly: https://www.grammarly.com/ (using American English).
* [ ] If you can, reduce the code - you're explaining a concept, hence having lots of code makes the article only longer without adding a real information. Short code examples -> detailed description of the concept is the way to go.
* [ ] Keep the article formal - reduce/remove the slang expressions and the punctuations like `...` if not strictly necessary.
* [ ] Use the oxford comma (setting up Grammarly to use American English should forces you to use it)
* [ ] Do not hotlink images: put the images inside a subfolder in the images folder of the blog and link there. Double check the images copyright before using them.
* [ ] The ideal article should start from a problem -> the article content should start from it and describe the flow to solve it.
